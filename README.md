# SOProject_POSIXThreads

## Overview

This project aims to implement a multithreaded program in C on Linux utilizing POSIX threads (Pthreads). The program incorporates various Pthread routines including:

- pthread_create
- pthread_exit
- pthread_cancel
- pthread_attr_init
- pthread_attr_destroy

## Requirements

- Linux Operating System
- C Compiler
- POSIX Threads library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the program using a C compiler.
3. Execute the compiled binary in the Linux terminal.
4. Follow the prompts or provide necessary inputs as per the program requirements.

## Functionality

The program demonstrates the following functionalities:
- Creation of multiple threads using pthread_create.
- Proper termination of threads with pthread_exit.
- Thread cancellation with pthread_cancel.
- Initialization and destruction of thread attributes with pthread_attr_init and pthread_attr_destroy, respectively.
